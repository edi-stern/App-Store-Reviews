Test assignment for the iOS Developer position.

Reviews app

1) Make a small app that has our review feed.
2) Add the possibility to filter by number of stars.
3) Show the top three occurring words in the filtered reviews (omit the ones less than 4 characters long).
4) Make use of native APIs and do not use 3rd party libraries.
5) Add more screens or UI-controls if needed.

We provide you a dummy app which already has a feed and details screens with some randomly generated data. Consider it as your starting point. Feel free to keep the layout untouched, we don't want you to waste your time on arranging the labels and fine-tuning the constraints. We are mostly curious about the business logic under the hood.

Feel free to change all the provided code if you want to. Itâ€™s there only to save you some time.

We expect to see a simple app but the one which is ready to be scaled up. Let's keep in mind more screens, user flows and services (e.g. Google Store reviews for example) which supposed to be added to the app in future.

If you have any questions or doubts make your own assumptions. But please convey the reasoning to us (code comments, documentation, some other way).
